{"name":"Bublcam SDK","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to GitHub Pages.\r\nIsn't it beautiful? This automatic page generator seems to think so.\r\n\r\n### Scarlet Beta Firmware\r\n\r\n**[Download Here!](https://github.com/BublTechnology/ScarletTests/releases)**\r\n\r\nPlace the downloaded `BUBL_UPD.BIN` in the root directory of your SD card. Insert the card into\r\nyour Bublcam when turned off and press the button to start it up. You should now be up and running\r\nwith the beta firmware!\r\n\r\n#### But I'm not!\r\n\r\nThe beta firmware will refuse to start if your Bublcam's battery is too low - sorry! Charge it and try again!\r\n\r\n\r\n### Important Notes\r\n\r\nPlease read and understand all of these!\r\n\r\n- Your camera will boot directly off of the SD card. **Removing the SD card when the Bublcam is on will cause bad things to happen.** Your camera's main firmware will be unaffected, and operation will resume as normal once the camera is off and SD card removed.\r\n- **It is possible that your camera settings will be erased.** While we are making a best effort to ensure the beta is stable, you may possibly lose settings such as: clock time, image alignment settings, capture settings, etc. These can be mostly restored the next time you connect the camera to the app.\r\n- **This is a beta and will contain bugs.** Yell at Aaron on Slack to report them! The firmware may or may not be good enough for casual use - updates to it will be announced on Slack.\r\n- **Everything is subject to change.** It's relatively stable right now, but nothing is guaranteed until a final release is made, particularly concerning the Bubl API extensions. It may evolve as we receive more feedback from our mobile team and community developers (yes you!).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Development Resources\r\n\r\n#### USB Connectivity\r\n\r\nThe beta firmware will attempt to connect to your computer via USB networking whenever it detects a connection. It will automatically assign itself the `192.168.2.2` IP. A simple `ifconfig usb0 192.168.2.1` should be enough to access it - modulo OS configuration differences. `BUBL_IP.TXT` on the SD card can provide a different IP to use (single line file). The magic \"dhcp\" string can be used to obtain an IP over DHCP, but no guarantees on how well that works - it may mesh better with the internet sharing features of OS X and Windows.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### API Documentation\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, we are implementing Google's [Open Spherical Camera API](https://developers.google.com/open-spherical-camera/), so go there for more information and documentation of the API. Additional Bubl vendor extensions are provided for our unique functionality such as video capture and preview, timelapses, and more. Documentation on these extensions will be available shortly\\*. For now, you're free to ask questions in chat..! The [ScarletTests](https://github.com/BublTechnology/ScarletTests) source code is provided as an example of how to interact and control the camera.\r\n\r\n\\* *valve time*\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Will the current Bublcam API still exist?\r\n\r\nIt's gone. Done. Laid to rest. Let's not talk about that.\r\n\r\n\r\n### What is this?\r\n\r\nA program for our community developers interested in controlling their shiny new Bublcam!
