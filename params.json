  "body": "# ScarletTests\r\n\r\nThese unit tests document our current support of the Open Spherical Camera API.\r\nThey are run and pass against our current implementation of the API, and\r\ndescribe the current Bubl vendor extensions to the API.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** Upgrade your mobile app to the latest release. This contains the latest version of the camera firmware and will allow you to update that to the latest supported release.\r\n\r\n## Client UI\r\n\r\nThe `client_ui` folder contains an angular web app that can be used to control\r\nthe camera. It's a very technical interface that allows you to try out different\r\nAPI endpoints and see what they return. To build and run it:\r\n\r\n    $ cd client_ui/\r\n    $ npm install\r\n    $ npm install bower\r\n    $ `npm bin`/bower install\r\n    $ `npm bin`/gulp serve\r\n\r\n## Server Tests\r\n\r\nThese unit tests can be run against the API server, and test the camera's\r\nvarious functionality. To run the tests:\r\n\r\n    $ npm install\r\n    $ `npm bin`/mocha\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nBoth projects use the `OscClient.js` file to connect to the camera. You will\r\nhave to adjust its default IP and port to match the camera on your network.\r\nIt will likely be `192.168.0.100:80`.\r\n\r\n# Licensing Information\r\n\r\nThis source release is licensed under the MIT license, which can be found\r\n[here](https://github.com/BublTechnology/ScarletTests/blob/master/COPYING).\r\n",
