# ScarletTests

These unit tests document our current support of the Open Spherical Camera API.
They are run and pass against our current implementation of the API, and
describe the current Bubl vendor extensions to the API.


# Beta Firmware

The latest beta firmware can be tested on your own bublcam! It exposes the
OSC API, see our beta download page for more information:
